# MicPlayback

## Introduction

This is a simple audio playback program, that feeds back the audio from any input device to any output device, I used it to hear my guitar through my headphones. If you wish to contribute or further develop this project, here are some ideas below.

## Why? Doesn't X already exist?

- I made this because I was struggling to find a similar project that met my needs.
- Just as a fun project to work on to pass time over Uni's summer break.
